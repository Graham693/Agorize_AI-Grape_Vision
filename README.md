# Grape Vine Disease Detection

## An Innovative Computer Vision Technique for Future Drone Application

Welcome to our machine learning project for the Agorize, "AI in Business" competition!

Our team name is ***Grape Vision*** and we're excited to show you some of the early stages of work we've put together.

For all the grape growers out there, are you tired of pacing up and down several acres of vineyard just to catch leafs with disease? Water stress? Pests? Localized fertilizer requirements? Well we have a solution for you!

**Our goal is to use drones to seamlessly and systematically survey vineyards to monitor grapevine health.** We can achieve this by mounting a image classification/object detection model onto a drone allowing grape growers to more efficiently monitor their operations. Drone scanning can help address localized vineyard issues like fungal diseases, water needs, and fertilizer needs to help optimize operations for the most high quality grapes. For now, our model only evaluates health in terms of disease, but we hope to eventually expand the dataset to use more "realistic" and "dirty" data with more health factors!

## To do:
- Add demo images to readme
- Add a validation set
- Longterm: more data
