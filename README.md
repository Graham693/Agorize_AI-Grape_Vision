# Grape Vision - Agorize AI
**This is a machine learning project for the Agorize AI competition. The goal is to develop a grapevine disease dectection model using convolutional neural networks.**

## TO DO
- Do research on CNN training on images
- Read about neural networks and how they're used for image recognition
- Do research on types of ML libraries fo rthe project (scikit learn, tensorflow, and pytorch)
- Start making a presentation template

- Decide on which ML library to try employing
- Data augmentation
- Compiling of all data into a directory for train, test, and validation
