# Grape Vine Disease Detection

## An Innovative Computer Vision Technique for Future Drone Application

Welcome to our machine learning project for the Agorize AI in Business competition. Our team name is ***Grape Vision*** and we're excited to show you some of the early stages of work we've put together! 

The goal is to develop a grapevine health monitoring system for seamlessly and systematically surveying vineyards using drone technology. The way to achieve this is to develop a convolutional neural network which can be mounted on a drone for realtime image analysis. This allows vineyards to more efficiently monitor operations and address localized issues like disease, water needs, fertilizer needs, and much more. For now, our model only evaluates health in terms of disease, but we hope to eventually expand the dataset to use more "realistic dirty data" with more health factors!

## To do:
- Add demo images to ReadMe
- Add validation dataset in addition to the testing set
- Longterm: more data
