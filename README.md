# Grape Vision - Agorize AI
**This is a machine learning project for the Agorize AI competition. The goal is to develop a grapevine disease dectection model using convolutional neural networks.**

## TO DO
- Work on presentation lololol
- Play with any other CNN model fits if there's time
- Data augmentation? Data is already somewhat aumented so this is fine.

## Presentation Link
